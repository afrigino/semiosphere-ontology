# Theoretical Foundations

This ontology is grounded in Juri Lotman’s theory of the semiosphere, developed within the Tartu–Moscow School of Semiotics.

## Core Commitments

### 1. The Whole Precedes the Parts
The semiosphere is ontologically prior to languages, texts, and codes.
No semiotic system exists independently of it.

### 2. Meaning Is Relational
Meaning does not reside inside objects or texts.
It emerges from relations, translation, and dialogue.

### 3. Boundaries Are Productive
Boundaries do not merely separate.
They generate meaning through translation and transformation.

### 4. Heterogeneity Is Constitutive
Every semiosphere contains multiple, non-identical systems.
Monoculture is a theoretical error.

### 5. Change Includes Unpredictability
Cultural “explosions” cannot be forecast.
They can only be identified retrospectively.

## Nonsemiotic Reality

“Nonsemiotic reality” is not an objective external world.
It is the semiosphere’s constructed notion of what lies beyond current meaning.

This ontology models it as a **limit concept**, not a populated domain.

---

## Dialogue vs Translation

- Translation transforms meaning across boundaries
- Dialogue sustains asymmetry, memory, and tension over time

They are related but not interchangeable.

---

## Anti-Reductionism

This ontology explicitly rejects:
- Physicalism
- Meaning-as-label
- Culture-as-dataset

Any computational use must preserve semiotic complexity.
