# Manifesto for a Disciplined Semiotic Ontology

Culture is not data.  
Meaning is not a label.  
Translation is not lossless.  
Change is not predictable.

This project exists to say **no** where computation usually says “close enough.”

We refuse:
- To turn the semiosphere into a container  
- To turn texts into data points  
- To turn boundaries into edges  
- To turn dialogue into messaging  
- To turn explosion into a parameter  

Instead, we build systems that fail when theory is violated.

This ontology does not explain culture.  
It constrains how culture may be modeled.

Anything that passes validation has already agreed to the theory.  
Anything that fails has learned something.

That is the point.
